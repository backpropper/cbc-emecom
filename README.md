Capacity, Bandwidth, and Compositionality in Emergent Language Learning
==================================
Code repository of the models described in the paper accepted at AAMAS 2020 
[Capacity, Bandwidth, and Compositionality in Emergent Language Learning](http://www.google.com "Capacity, Bandwidth, and Compositionality in Emergent Language Learning").

Dependencies
------------------
### Python
* Python>=3.6
* PyTorch>=1.2

### GPU
* CUDA>=10.1
* cuDNN>=7.6

Running code
------------------
```bash
$ python main.py --num-binary-messages 24 --num-digits 6 --embedding-size-sender 40 --project-size-sender 60 --num-lstm-sender 300 --num-lstm-receiver 325 --embedding-size-receiver 125 --save-str <SAVE_STR>
```
where `num-binary-messages` is the bandwidth, `num-digits` is the number of concepts, and `<SAVE_STR>` is the filename.
